Sifteo Game Jam game

Super Space Cube is a cooperative game in the vain of Spaceteam and Artemis. Three classes work together to defend the space ship against aliens, asteroids, and space gas. By tapping and combining the cubes in different ways the players can help each other fend off the foes.

 * The Captain character can fire the guns at asteroids and aliens and when he is connected to an other player he can assist them with their task.
 * The Engineer produces power and when connected to another player, transfers that power to them.
 * The Scientist holds up the shields and when connected to another player, is able to repair their unit.

If the fleet is unable to overcome their foe, one of the units becomes damaged, and the scientist must repair them. If all units become damaged then the game is lost.
